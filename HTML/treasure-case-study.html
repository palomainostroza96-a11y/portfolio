            TREASURE<br>
            OF ITZA
          </h1>
          <p class="project-summary">
            Treasure of Itza is a board game concept inspired by ancient civilizations and adventure storytelling. The goal was to design an engaging, strategic experience where players explore an island, collect resources, and complete quests. Our team developed the concept from early brainstorming to a fully playable prototype through continuous testing, iteration, and user feedback. The result is a dynamic, replayable game that combines creativity, exploration, and strategic decision-making.

      <div class="challenge-content">
        <div class="challenge-text">
          <p>
            Our mission was to design a unique and engaging adventure board game concept. From the start, our team wanted to create something historically inspired that combined exploration, resource management, and strategic gameplay.
          </p>
          <p>
            After brainstorming several directions, we decided to base our concept around ancient civilizations, ultimately drawing inspiration from the Inca pyramids and the myths surrounding hidden treasures — which led to the creation of Treasure of Itza.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>We began with two competing ideas:</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="challenge-list">
            <li>A game set on an island where players could explore freely and take on different character roles.</li>
            <li>A pyramid-based exploration game where everyone played as an explorer.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To decide which direction to pursue, we conducted an early mini playtest by pitching both ideas to friends and family. The majority found the island adventure concept more engaging due to its freedom and variety of characters. Based on this feedback, <strong>Treasure of Itza was born.</strong>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Concept Development</h3>
      <p class="section-intro">
        We aimed to design a strategy-based adventure game where players explore an island using hexagonal tiles representing different biomes such as water, forest, and mountains. The modular layout allows every playthrough to be different.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Playtesting Methodology</h3>
      <p class="section-intro">
        We ran a total of <strong>five playtests</strong> during the project:
      </p>
      <ul class="playtest-list">
        <li>Three in the early phase to validate the game mechanics and layout</li>
        <li>Two in the final stages to test the complete game experience</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Our approach followed an iterative design process, using each test as a feedback loop to improve usability, rules clarity, and player engagement.

          <span class="test-meta">3 classmates</span>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Test player understanding of the hexagonal board concept.</p>
        <p>We presented a low-fidelity paper prototype, asking players to assemble the board freely in one scenario and using a pre-numbered sequence in another.</p>
        
        <h4 class="findings-title">Findings:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Players enjoyed the flexibility of the hexagonal design, which allowed open movement.</li>
          <li>However, without structure, players felt unsure about "correct" placement.</li>
          <li>A pre-defined order created confidence, but players wanted visual clarity and rules for orientation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="iteration-note"><strong>Iteration:</strong> We decided to generate clearer visuals and introduce a consistent visual pattern to help players feel guided without losing creative freedom.</p>

        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Evaluate clarity and engagement with the new board visuals.</p>
        <p>This version featured hexagonal clusters printed on paper resembling a honeycomb pattern. We repeated the two-scenario method (free vs. pre-defined layout).</p>
        
        <h4 class="findings-title">Findings:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Players found the new board easier to understand and assemble.</li>
          <li>The improved visuals created logical patterns, reducing confusion.</li>
          <li>Most preferred the structured board if the layout was visually clear.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="iteration-note"><strong>Iteration:</strong> We decided to mount the board pieces on cardboard for stability, as the paper tiles were too slippery during gameplay.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Fixed resource locations created better balance and less cognitive load.</li>

          <li>Players enjoyed the freedom and theme but struggled to remember resource rules and card effects.</li>

          <li>Some symbols were unclear, and event card effects were hard to recall.</li>

          <li>Players found the game easier to understand and more enjoyable.</li>
          <li>Still noted that "backpacks" (inventory slots for resources) needed better marking or a grid system to track capacity.</li>
          <li>Appreciated the action point system, allowing flexible strategies.</li>
