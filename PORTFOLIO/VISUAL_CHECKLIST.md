## üéØ Overall Visual Goals

When viewing the hero section, you should feel:

‚úÖ **"This looks like a premium, modern design"**  
‚úÖ **"The glass frame feels real and dimensional"**  
‚úÖ **"The lighting creates atmosphere without overwhelming"**  
‚úÖ **"The portrait looks naturally lit by studio lights"**  
‚úÖ **"Everything feels cohesive and integrated"**  
‚úÖ **"The animations are subtle but add life"**  
‚úÖ **"This is professional-grade UI design"**

## üîç Quick Visual Test

1. **Refresh the page** - Observe the initial load
2. **Wait 10 seconds** - Watch for the diagonal light beam sweep
3. **Watch "PALOMA"** - Look for subtle breathing glow (6s loop)
4. **Hover over nav links** - Check underline animation
5. **Hover over buttons** - Check lift and glow effects
6. **Resize browser window** - Test responsive breakpoints
7. **Check mobile view** - Verify reduced glows and vertical stack

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If background looks flat/black:
- Check that `hero-spec.css` is loaded (not cached old version)
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### If glass frame is too opaque:
- Check `background: rgba(18,22,28,0.55)` in CSS
- Verify `backdrop-filter: blur(22px)` is supported in your browser

### If animations don't work:
- Check browser supports CSS animations (all modern browsers do)
- Verify no "Reduced Motion" setting is enabled in OS

### If glows are not visible:
- Check `box-shadow` with multiple rgba() values
- Ensure browser supports multiple box-shadows (all modern browsers do)
